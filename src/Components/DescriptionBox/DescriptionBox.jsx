          If you thought it was impossible to find true support and true comfort
          in a wireless bra, Playtex® 18 Hour® Ultimate Lift and Support
          Wireless Bra is your dream come true. The Playtex people know just
          about everything when it comes to support. They have designed this
          wireless bra with Magic Ring® construction for natural, rounded lift
          using the TruSupport® 4-way support system with higher sides to help
          control bulges, fuller cups for natural shaping, wider straps for
          all-day ease, and a smoother back for stability. It's all built around
          the famous Playtex 18 Hour M-Frame™ cup that has been giving women
          comfortable support for decades. The satiny, moisture-wicking jacquard
          fabric with delicate picot trim helps keep you cool in any season,
          with stretch satin sides and back for even more smooth comfort.
          Cushioned straps take the pressure off your shoulders for no-dig,
          no-slide comfort. When it comes to support and comfort, the Ultimate
          Lift and Support full-coverage, wireless bra is the real deal.
